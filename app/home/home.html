        </div>
        <div class="text-text">
            Fuel Economizer is a currently in-development application to track fuel economy and maybe other things
            about your vehicle.  Right now we're in active development (check it out
            <a href="http://github.com/Dorthu/FuelEconomizer" target="_blank">on github</a>) and registration is manual
            (contact me if you want to sign up).

            How To Use
        </div>
        <div class="text-text">
            Fuel Economizer is very simple to use!  When you're at the pump, enter in three simple pieces of data:
            your current odometer reading, the amount of gas you bought, and the price you paid - done and done!  After
            a few data points are added, Fuel Economizer can begin showing you valuable information about your fuel
            economy, whenever you're interested!
