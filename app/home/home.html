        <div class="text-text">
            Fuel Economizer is a currently in-development application to track fuel economy and maybe other things
            about your vehicle.  Right now we're in active development (check it out
            <a href="http://github.com/Dorthu/FuelEconomizer" target="_blank">on github</a>) and registration is manual
            (contact me if you want to sign up).

            Why Fuel Economy
        </div>
        <div class="text-text">
            How much do you spend on gas a year?  How many miles do you drive in a month?  What is the actual cost of
            maintaining your car?  You probably don't know, really.  And it's no surprise - it would take a lof of effort
            to gather all of that information and turn it into cool, useful graphs.
            <br/><br/>
            But fear no more!  Fuel Economizer can provide you with all that and more - for almost no effort!  Just open
            it up while you're at the pump, punch in three immediately-available data points (odometer reading, gas purchased,
            and total price paid) and be on your way.  After a few entries, Fuel Economizer will begin displaying
            valuable information, whenever you're interested in looking.
